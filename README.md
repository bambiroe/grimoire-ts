## ✨ About

**Grimoire.ts** is a personal frontend project that explores the intersection of technology, plant knowledge, and modern witchcraft. The goal was to create a digital repository for plants and spells, combining curated data with interactive features for a peaceful, reflective experience.

This project is designed to provide an **easy-to-use interface** for anyone who wants to browse plant information or learn about simple rituals and spells, all stored in a digital grimoire format.

## 🌱 Features

- Curated plant and herb entries with details like uses, notes, and images.
- Interactive plant filtering and spell search.
- Clean, minimal interface.
- Structured data powered by TypeScript for better organization and scalability.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- `CSS`
- `TypeScript`

## 🔮 Future Ideas
